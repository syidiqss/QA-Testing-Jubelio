Introduction
Testing is a crucial step in the software development lifecycle. Jubelio is an important application, and with this guide, you can understand how to perform testing using various useful tools.

Testing with Jira
Jira is a powerful project management tool that can be used to track, manage, and report various tasks, including testing. You can use Jira to create, manage, and track test case tickets and assign testing tasks to your team.

Common steps for testing with Jira include:

Creating test case tickets for the test scenarios to be executed.
Tracking test results on those test case tickets.
Reporting bugs if any bugs are found during testing.
Compiling comprehensive test reports.
Testing with Postman
Postman is a handy tool for automating API testing. You can use Postman to send HTTP requests to the Jubelio application and check the responses. This is useful for ensuring that the APIs are functioning correctly.

Common steps for testing with Postman include:

Creating collections of API requests needed for testing.
Defining variables and environments suitable for your testing.
Running the test collections to test the APIs.
Checking the response and data validity received from the APIs.
Selenium WebDriver Automation
WebDriver Selenium is a valuable tool for automating GUI testing of the Jubelio web application. You can create automated test scripts that execute specific steps within the web application and verify that everything is functioning correctly.

Common steps for using Selenium WebDriver for automated testing include:

Creating test scripts using a supported programming language by Selenium (e.g., Python, Java, or JavaScript).
Identifying elements within the web application to interact with.
Running the test scripts to automate the testing steps.
Reporting test results, whether successful or failed.
Running Test Suites
To run a complete test suite that includes testing with Jira, testing with Postman, and automated testing with Selenium WebDriver, you can follow these steps:

Ensure you have access to the appropriate Jira and Postman accounts required for testing.
Ensure you have configured the necessary environment and dependencies to run Selenium WebDriver scripts.
Start with testing in Jira by creating test case tickets and tracking their results.
Next, run testing with Postman to check the APIs used by Jubelio.
Finally, run automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver to test the Jubelio web application's user interface.
